Web project that utilizes Compass as a CSS preprocessor involves a few steps. Let's go through them in detail:

**1. Setting Up Your Development Environment:**

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Ruby:** Compass is built using Ruby, so you'll need to have Ruby installed. You can download it from the official Ruby website.

- **RubyGems:** RubyGems is the package manager for Ruby. It should be included with your Ruby installation.

- **Text Editor:** You'll need a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write your code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

**2. Install Compass:**

Once you have Ruby and RubyGems installed, open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command to install Compass:

```bash
gem install compass
```

This will download and install the Compass gem, allowing you to use the Compass command-line tool.

**3. Create a New Project:**

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and execute the following command to create a new Compass project:

```bash
compass create project-name
```

Replace `project-name` with the desired name of your project. This command will set up the basic structure of your project, including directories for stylesheets, images, and more.

**4. Structure of the Compass Project:**

After creating the project, you'll find a directory structure similar to this:

```
project-name/
├── config.rb
├── sass/
│   ├── styles.scss
├── css/
└── images/
```

- `config.rb`: This file contains configuration settings for your Compass project. You can customize various options here.

- `sass/`: This directory is where you'll place your Sass/Compass stylesheets.

- `css/`: This directory is where Compass will output the compiled CSS files.

- `images/`: This is where you can place your images, including sprite images if you plan to use them.

**5. Writing Compass Styles:**

Open the `sass/styles.scss` file in your chosen text editor. This is where you'll write your Sass/Compass styles using mixins and functions from Compass.

For example, you can use Compass mixins to create a gradient background:

```scss
@import "compass";
@import "compass/css3";

.my-element {
  @include background(linear-gradient(to bottom, red, blue));
}
```

**6. Compiling Compass Styles:**

To compile your Compass styles into CSS, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
compass compile
```

Compass will process the `styles.scss` file, apply mixins and other features, and generate a corresponding CSS file in the `css/` directory.

**7. Integrating with Version Control (Git):**

To create a Git repository for your project, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This initializes a new Git repository, adds your project files, and creates an initial commit.

**8. Push to Remote Repository:**

If you're using a remote repository hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, follow their instructions to create a new repository on the platform. Then, connect your local repository to the remote repository and push your code:

```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your remote repository.

That's it! You've set up a Compass-powered web project, written Compass styles, compiled them into CSS, and created a Git repository to track your code changes. Remember that this is a general guide, and you may need to adapt the instructions based on your specific project requirements and tools.
